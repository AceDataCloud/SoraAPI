# Sora Videos Generation API Integration Instructions

This article will introduce the integration instructions for the Sora Videos Generation API, which can generate official Sora videos by inputting custom parameters.

## Application Process

To use the API, you need to first apply for the corresponding service on the [Sora Videos Generation API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/99a24421-2e22-4028-8201-e19cb834b67e) page. After entering the page, click the "Acquire" button, as shown in the image:

If you are not logged in or registered, you will be automatically redirected to the login page inviting you to register and log in. After logging in or registering, you will be automatically returned to the current page.

Upon your first application, there will be a free quota offered, allowing you to use the API for free.

## Basic Usage

First, understand the basic usage method, which involves inputting the prompt `prompt`, an array of reference image links `image_urls`, and the model `model` to obtain the processed result. The specific content is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/h8dyz3.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Here, we can see that we have set the Request Headers, including:

- `accept`: the format of the response result you want to receive, filled in as `application/json`, which means JSON format.
- `authorization`: the key to call the API, which can be selected directly after application.

Additionally, the Request Body is set, including:

- `model`: the model for generating the video, mainly `sora-2` and `sora-2-pro`. Currently, `sora-2` and `sora-2-pro` allow you to choose the `size` and `duration` parameters for the video, where `sora-2-pro` supports a `duration` of 25 seconds, while `sora-2` only supports 10 and 15 seconds.
- `size`: the clarity of the video generation task, which can be `small` or `large`.
- `image_urls`: the array of reference image links or Base64 encoded images to be uploaded.
- `duration`: the duration of the video generation task, which can be 10s, 15s, or 25s, with only `sora-2-pro` supporting 25s.
- `character_start`/`character_end`: the starting and ending positions of the character in the frame (0-1), used to control the position of the subject.
- `orientation`: the aspect ratio, supporting `landscape`, `portrait`, or `square`.
- `prompt`: the prompt.
- `callback_url`: the URL to which the result needs to be sent back.

After selection, you can see that the corresponding code is generated on the right side, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/g04qjz.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Click the "Try" button to test, as shown in the image above, and we get the following result:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "6bf7fb83-5814-4e3e-a4ad-bfa0c26c0b33",
  "trace_id": "96166698-4b66-478d-a26b-77a7269c9e01",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "sora-2:task_01k7770rgsevxsmtpbn7xnm5gh",
      "video_url": "https://filesystem.site/gptimage/vg-assets/assets%2Ftask_01k7770rgsevxsmtpbn7xnm5gh%2Ftask_01k7770rgsevxsmtpbn7xnm5gh_genid_0bf958d3-cae7-4298-b7b6-99ae439a1ea6_25_10_10_14_06_975715%2Fvideos%2F00000%2Fsrc.mp4?st=2025-10-10T12%3A30%3A38Z&se=2025-10-16T13%3A30%3A38Z&sks=b&skt=2025-10-10T12%3A30%3A38Z&ske=2025-10-16T13%3A30%3A38Z&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skoid=8ebb0df1-a278-4e2e-9c20-f2d373479b3a&skv=2019-02-02&sv=2018-11-09&sr=b&sp=r&spr=https%2Chttp&sig=jigY6Z5qp8%2BTXYobaW0EAJ4%2Fbx6G7t6V1P0iyDeUq48%3D&az=oaivgprodscus",
      "state": "succeeded"
    }
  ]
}
```

The returned result contains multiple fields, described as follows:

- `success`: the status of the video generation task at this time.
- `task_id`: the ID of the video generation task at this time.
- `trace_id`: the tracking ID of the video generation at this time.
- `data`: the result list of the video generation task at this time.
  - `id`: the video ID of the video generation task at this time.
  - `video_url`: the video link of the video generation task at this time.
  - `state`: the status of the video generation task at this time.

We can see that we have obtained satisfactory video information, and we only need to access the generated Sora video using the video link address in the `data` result.

Additionally, if you want to generate the corresponding integration code, you can directly copy the generated code, such as the CURL code below:

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/sora/videos' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "size": "large",
  "duration": 15,
  "orientation": "landscape",
  "prompt": "cat running on the river",
  "model": "sora-2"
}'
```

## Image to Video Task

If you want to create an image to video task, the parameter `image_urls` must first be passed with the reference image links, allowing you to specify the following content:

- image_urls: the array of reference image links used for this image to video task.

An example of the input is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/ch7x3t.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

After filling it out, the code is automatically generated as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/z1ud8l.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

The corresponding code:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/sora/videos"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "size": "large",
    "duration": 15,
    "orientation": "landscape",
    "prompt": "cat running on the river",
    "model": "sora-2",
    "image_urls": ["https://cdn.acedata.cloud/11wfp4.png"]
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

Clicking run, you will find that a result is immediately obtained, as follows:
```
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "dd392ff0-dcb7-4c7a-afd0-9bd4f65c803a",
  "trace_id": "04fd151c-e942-4c1c-a6ab-9a1b1fe54172",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "sora-2:task_01k777af4hfmg9g7yfvwsc6zws",
      "video_url": "https://filesystem.site/gptimage/vg-assets/assets%2Ftask_01k777af4hfmg9g7yfvwsc6zws%2Ftask_01k777af4hfmg9g7yfvwsc6zws_genid_92bae0c5-1703-4a5f-9d9f-c9ed2f9e7176_25_10_10_14_12_924695%2Fvideos%2F00000%2Fsrc.mp4?st=2025-10-10T12%3A37%3A32Z&se=2025-10-16T13%3A37%3A32Z&sks=b&skt=2025-10-10T12%3A37%3A32Z&ske=2025-10-16T13%3A37%3A32Z&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skoid=aa5ddad1-c91a-4f0a-9aca-e20682cc8969&skv=2019-02-02&sv=2018-11-09&sr=b&sp=r&spr=https%2Chttp&sig=5j4dibeaSsDmEka5c%2B9CKHZhRPdqfClQ0tIh03TWXsM%3D&az=oaivgprodscus",
      "state": "succeeded"
    }
  ]
}
```

It can be seen that the generated effect is a video created from images, and the result is similar to the above text.

## Character Generation Video Task

If you want to generate a character video task, the parameter `character_url` must first be passed in with the video link needed to create the character. Note that the video must not contain real people, otherwise it will fail. You can specify the following content:

- character_url: The video link needed to create the character. Note that the video must not contain real people, otherwise it will fail.

An example of filling in is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/2nhdr2.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

After filling it out, the code is automatically generated as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/xp8scl.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

The corresponding code:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/sora/videos"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "size": "small",
    "duration": 10,
    "orientation": "landscape",
    "prompt": "cat running on the river",
    "character_url": "https://cdn.acedata.cloud/pdidf5.mp4",
    "model": "sora-2",
    "character_end": 3,
    "character_start": 1
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

Clicking run, you can find that you will immediately get a result, as follows:

```
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "d9bf5461-29b5-47fd-be90-1fe9197df259",
  "trace_id": "b7992643-9207-40d6-956b-7577728acc67",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "sora-2:task_01k8ykrztefavaypw6xanw305b",
      "video_url": "https://filesystem.site/cdn/20251101/bee4eeeb4c4660b46dac4548a1ffbc.mp4",
      "state": "succeeded"
    }
  ]
}
```

It can be seen that the generated effect is a character generation video, and the result is similar to the above text.

## Asynchronous Callback

Since the Sora Videos Generation API takes a relatively long time to generate, about 1-2 minutes, if the API does not respond for a long time, the HTTP request will keep the connection open, leading to additional system resource consumption. Therefore, this API also provides support for asynchronous callbacks.

The overall process is: when the client initiates a request, an additional `callback_url` field is specified. After the client initiates the API request, the API will immediately return a result containing a `task_id` field, representing the current task ID. When the task is completed, the result of the generated video will be sent to the client-specified `callback_url` in the form of a POST JSON, which also includes the `task_id` field, so that the task result can be associated by ID.

Let’s understand how to operate specifically through an example.

First, the Webhook callback is a service that can receive HTTP requests, and developers should replace it with the URL of their own HTTP server. For demonstration purposes, we use a public Webhook sample site https://webhook.site/. Open this site to get a Webhook URL, as shown in the figure:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/cjjfly.png)

Copy this URL, and it can be used as a Webhook. The sample here is `https://webhook.site/eb238c4f-da3b-47a5-a922-a93aa5405daa`.

Next, we can set the field `callback_url` to the above Webhook URL, while filling in the corresponding parameters, as shown in the figure:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/v1m05g.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Clicking run, you can find that you will immediately get a result, as follows:

```
{
  "task_id": "b8976e18-32dc-4718-9ed8-1ea090fcb6ea"
}
```

After a moment, we can observe the result of the generated song at `https://webhook.site/eb238c4f-da3b-47a5-a922-a93aa5405daa`, as shown in the figure:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/0j7nra.png)

The content is as follows:
```
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "task_id": "b8976e18-32dc-4718-9ed8-1ea090fcb6ea",
    "trace_id": "fb751e1e-4705-49ea-9fd4-5024b7865ea2",
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "sora-2:task_01k777hjrbfrgs2060q5zvf2a5",
            "video_url": "https://filesystem.site/gptimage/vg-assets/assets%2Ftask_01k777hjrbfrgs2060q5zvf2a5%2Ftask_01k777hjrbfrgs2060q5zvf2a5_genid_b8e2e5d1-a579-49ca-a21c-cb3869685cce_25_10_10_14_15_147334%2Fvideos%2F00000%2Fsrc.mp4?st=2025-10-10T12%3A38%3A49Z&se=2025-10-16T13%3A38%3A49Z&sks=b&skt=2025-10-10T12%3A38%3A49Z&ske=2025-10-16T13%3A38%3A49Z&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skoid=aa5ddad1-c91a-4f0a-9aca-e20682cc8969&skv=2019-02-02&sv=2018-11-09&sr=b&sp=r&spr=https%2Chttp&sig=p4aMqXqkP%2FI1IhOVGCB9JL8vUUvfNBBF12ESpKhKXOk%3D&az=oaivgprodscus",
            "state": "succeeded"
        }
    ]
}
```

You can see that the result contains a `task_id` field, and other fields are similar to the above text. This field can be used to associate tasks.

## Error Handling

When calling the API, if an error occurs, the API will return the corresponding error code and message. For example:

- `400 token_mismatched`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `400 api_not_implemented`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `401 invalid_token`: Unauthorized, invalid or missing authorization token.
- `429 too_many_requests`: Too many requests, you have exceeded the rate limit.
- `500 api_error`: Internal server error, something went wrong on the server.

### Error Response Example

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "api_error",
    "message": "fetch failed"
  },
  "trace_id": "2cf86e86-22a4-46e1-ac2f-032c0f2a4e89"
}
```
