# Sora Videos Generation API Integration Instructions

This article will introduce the integration instructions for the Sora Videos Generation API, which allows you to input custom parameters to generate videos from Sora. This API supports two version modes:

- **Version 1 (Classic Mode)**: Supports `duration` (10/15/25 seconds), `orientation` (landscape/portrait), `size` (small/large resolution), reference image `image_urls`, character **###** `character_url`, and other parameters.
- **Version 2 (Partner Mode)**: Supports `seconds` (4/8/12 seconds), pixel-level resolution `size` (e.g., 1280x720), reference image `input_reference`, and other parameters.

## Application Process

To use the Sora Videos Generation API, first go to the [Ace Data Cloud Console](https://platform.acedata.cloud/console/applications) to obtain your API Token for future use.

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/dvc3cg.jpg)

If you are not logged in or registered, you will be automatically redirected to the login page to invite you to register and log in. After completing this, you will be automatically returned to the current page.

**One API Token can call all services on the platform without needing to apply separately for each service.** The first application will grant a free quota for a trial experience; when the quota is insufficient, you can recharge the general balance in the [console](https://platform.acedata.cloud/console/coin).

## Basic Usage (Version 1)

First, understand the basic usage of Version 1, which involves inputting the prompt `prompt`, an array of reference image links `image_urls`, and the model `model` to obtain the processed result. The specific content is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/h8dyz3.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Here we can see that we have set the Request Headers, including:

- `accept`: The format of the response result you want to receive, filled in as `application/json`, which means JSON format.
- `authorization`: The key to call the API, which can be selected directly after application.

Additionally, the Request Body is set, including:

- `model`: The model for generating the video, supporting `sora-2` (standard mode) and `sora-2-pro` (high-definition mode). The `sora-2-pro` supports videos with a `duration` of 25 seconds, while `sora-2` only supports 10 and 15 seconds.
- `size`: Video resolution, `small` for standard resolution, `large` for HD resolution (only Version 1).
- `duration`: Video length, supporting 10, 15, and 25 seconds, with 25 seconds only supported by `sora-2-pro` (only Version 1).
- `orientation`: Aspect ratio direction, supporting `landscape` (horizontal) and `portrait` (vertical) (only Version 1).
- `image_urls`: An array of reference image links used for image-to-video generation (only Version 1).
- `character_url`: Character **###** link, real people cannot appear in the video (only Version 1).
- `character_start`/`character_end`: The start and end seconds for the character's appearance, with a range difference of 1-3 seconds (only Version 1).
- `prompt`: Prompt word (required).
- `callback_url`: URL for asynchronous callback results.
- `async`: Optional, set to `true` for the interface to immediately return `task_id`, without needing to provide `callback_url`, and then poll the corresponding task query interface to obtain results.
- `version`: API version, `"1.0"` (default) or `"2.0"`.

After selection, you can see that the corresponding code is generated on the right side, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/g04qjz.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Click the "Try" button to test, as shown in the image above, and we obtained the following result:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "6bf7fb83-5814-4e3e-a4ad-bfa0c26c0b33",
  "trace_id": "96166698-4b66-478d-a26b-77a7269c9e01",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "sora-2:task_01k7770rgsevxsmtpbn7xnm5gh",
      "video_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/gptimage/vg-assets/assets%2Ftask_01k7770rgsevxsmtpbn7xnm5gh%2Ftask_01k7770rgsevxsmtpbn7xnm5gh_genid_0bf958d3-cae7-4298-b7b6-99ae439a1ea6_25_10_10_14_06_975715%2Fvideos%2F00000%2Fsrc.mp4?st=2025-10-10T12%3A30%3A38Z&se=2025-10-16T13%3A30%3A38Z&sks=b&skt=2025-10-10T12%3A30%3A38Z&ske=2025-10-16T13%3A30%3A38Z&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skoid=8ebb0df1-a278-4e2e-9c20-f2d373479b3a&skv=2019-02-02&sv=2018-11-09&sr=b&sp=r&spr=https%2Chttp&sig=jigY6Z5qp8%2BTXYobaW0EAJ4%2Fbx6G7t6V1P0iyDeUq48%3D&az=oaivgprodscus",
      "state": "succeeded"
    }
  ]
}
```

The returned result contains multiple fields, described as follows:

- `success`: The status of the video generation task at this time.
- `task_id`: The ID of the video generation task at this time.
- `trace_id`: The tracking ID of the video generation at this time.
- `data`: The result list of the video generation task at this time.
    - `id`: The video ID of the video generation task at this time.
    - `video_url`: The video link of the video generation task at this time.
    - `state`: The status of the video generation task at this time.

We can see that we have obtained satisfactory video information, and we only need to access the generated Sora video using the video link address in `data`.

Additionally, if you want to generate the corresponding integration code, you can directly copy the generated code, for example, the CURL code is as follows:

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/sora/videos' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "size": "large",
  "duration": 15,
  "orientation": "landscape",
  "prompt": "cat running on the river",
  "model": "sora-2"
}'
```

## Image-to-Video Task (Version 1)

If you want to perform an image-to-video task, the parameter `image_urls` must be passed with reference image links, allowing you to specify the following content:

- `image_urls`: An array of reference image links used for this image-to-video task. Note that you cannot pass real images of people with faces, as this may lead to task failure.

An example of the input is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/ch7x3t.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

After filling in, the code is automatically generated as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/z1ud8l.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

The corresponding code:
```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/sora/videos"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "size": "large",
    "duration": 15,
    "orientation": "landscape",
    "prompt": "cat running on the river",
    "model": "sora-2",
    "image_urls": ["https://cdn.acedata.cloud/11wfp4.png"]
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

Click to run, and you will find that you will immediately get a result as follows:

```
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "dd392ff0-dcb7-4c7a-afd0-9bd4f65c803a",
  "trace_id": "04fd151c-e942-4c1c-a6ab-9a1b1fe54172",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "sora-2:task_01k777af4hfmg9g7yfvwsc6zws",
      "video_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/gptimage/vg-assets/assets%2Ftask_01k777af4hfmg9g7yfvwsc6zws%2Ftask_01k777af4hfmg9g7yfvwsc6zws_genid_92bae0c5-1703-4a5f-9d9f-c9ed2f9e7176_25_10_10_14_12_924695%2Fvideos%2F00000%2Fsrc.mp4?st=2025-10-10T12%3A37%3A32Z&se=2025-10-16T13%3A37%3A32Z&sks=b&skt=2025-10-10T12%3A37%3A32Z&ske=2025-10-16T13%3A37%3A32Z&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skoid=aa5ddad1-c91a-4f0a-9aca-e20682cc8969&skv=2019-02-02&sv=2018-11-09&sr=b&sp=r&spr=https%2Chttp&sig=5j4dibeaSsDmEka5c%2B9CKHZhRPdqfClQ0tIh03TWXsM%3D&az=oaivgprodscus",
      "state": "succeeded"
    }
  ]
}
```

It can be seen that the generated effect is a video generated from an image, and the result is similar to the above.

## Character Generation Video Task (Version 1)

If you want to perform a character generation video task, the parameter `character_url` must first be passed in the video link needed to create the character. Note that there must be no real people appearing in the video, otherwise it will fail. You can specify the following content:

- character_url: The video link needed to create the character. Note that there must be no real people appearing in the video, otherwise it will fail.

An example of filling in is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/2nhdr2.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

After filling it out, the code is automatically generated as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/xp8scl.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

The corresponding code:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/sora/videos"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "size": "small",
    "duration": 10,
    "orientation": "landscape",
    "prompt": "cat running on the river",
    "character_url": "https://cdn.acedata.cloud/pdidf5.mp4",
    "model": "sora-2",
    "character_end": 3,
    "character_start": 1
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

Click to run, and you will find that you will immediately get a result as follows:

```
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "d9bf5461-29b5-47fd-be90-1fe9197df259",
  "trace_id": "b7992643-9207-40d6-956b-7577728acc67",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "sora-2:task_01k8ykrztefavaypw6xanw305b",
      "video_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/20251101/bee4eeeb4c4660b46dac4548a1ffbc.mp4",
      "state": "succeeded"
    }
  ]
}
```

It can be seen that the generated effect is a character generation video, and the result is similar to the above.

## Version 2.0 Mode

In addition to the above Version 1.0 mode, this API also supports Version 2.0 mode, which can be enabled by setting the `version` parameter to `"2.0"`. Version 2.0 mode supports shorter video durations and pixel-level resolution control.

### Version 2.0 Parameter Description

| Parameter        | Type     | Required | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`        | string   | Yes      | Set to `"2.0"`                                         |
| `prompt`         | string   | Yes      | The prompt for generating the video                     |
| `model`          | string   | No       | `sora-2` (default) or `sora-2-pro`                     |
| `duration`       | integer  | No       | Video duration: `4` (default), `8`, `12` seconds       |
| `size`           | string   | No       | Resolution: `720x1280` (default), `1280x720`, `1024x1792`, `1792x1024` |
| `image_urls`     | array    | No       | Array of reference image URLs, only the first image is used, and the image size must match the `size` parameter |
| `callback_url`   | string   | No       | Asynchronous callback URL                               |

### Basic Example

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/sora/videos' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "version": "2.0",
  "prompt": "cat running on the river",
  "model": "sora-2",
  "duration": 8,
  "size": "1280x720"
}'
```

The corresponding Python code:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/sora/videos"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "version": "2.0",
    "prompt": "cat running on the river",
    "model": "sora-2",
    "seconds": 8,
    "size": "1280x720"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

The corresponding JavaScript code:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.acedata.cloud/sora/videos', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'accept': 'application/json',
    'authorization': 'Bearer {token}',
    'content-type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    version: '2.0',
    prompt: 'cat running on the river',
    model: 'sora-2',
    seconds: 8,
    size: '1280x720'
  })
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

The return result format is the same as Version 1.
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "6bf7fb83-5814-4e3e-a4ad-bfa0c26c0b33",
  "trace_id": "96166698-4b66-478d-a26b-77a7269c9e01",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "c0cc8dad-0954-421f-be8d-02eb063b3263",
      "video_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/sora/xxxxx.mp4",
      "state": "succeeded"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Use Reference Image (Version 2.0)

In Version 2.0 mode, you can pass reference images through the `image_urls` parameter to guide video generation (only the first image is used):

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/sora/videos"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "version": "2.0",
    "prompt": "a person walking through a beautiful garden",
    "model": "sora-2",
    "duration": 4,
    "size": "1280x720",
    "image_urls": ["https://cdn.acedata.cloud/11wfp4.png"]
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

> **Note**: The size of the reference image should match the `size` parameter, for example, when `size` is `1280x720`, the reference image size should be 1280×720.

### Comparison of Parameters Between Version 1.0 and Version 2.0

| Parameter         | Version 1.0           | Version 2.0                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `version`        | 1.0 (default)        | 2.0                                     |
| `prompt`         | ✅                     | ✅                                       |
| `model`          | ✅ sora-2 / sora-2-pro | ✅ sora-2 / sora-2-pro                   |
| `duration`       | ✅ 10/15/25 seconds    | ✅ 4/8/12 seconds                        |
| `orientation`    | ✅ landscape/portrait  | ❌                                       |
| `size`           | ✅ small/large         | ✅ 720x1280/1280x720/1024x1792/1792x1024 |
| `image_urls`     | ✅ multiple reference images | ✅ only the first one                     |
| `character_url`  | ✅                     | ❌                                       |
| `callback_url`   | ✅                     | ✅                                       |

## Asynchronous Callback

Due to the relatively long generation time of the Sora Videos Generation API, which takes about 1-2 minutes, if the API does not respond for a long time, the HTTP request will keep the connection open, leading to additional system resource consumption. Therefore, this API also provides support for asynchronous callbacks.

The overall process is: when the client initiates a request, an additional `callback_url` field is specified. After the client initiates the API request, the API will immediately return a result containing a `task_id` field, representing the current task ID. When the task is completed, the result of the generated video will be sent to the client-specified `callback_url` in the form of a POST JSON, which also includes the `task_id` field, allowing the task result to be associated by ID.

Let's understand how to operate specifically through an example.

First, the Webhook callback is a service that can receive HTTP requests, and developers should replace it with the URL of their own HTTP server. For demonstration purposes, we use a public Webhook sample site https://webhook.site/, where you can open the site to get a Webhook URL, as shown in the image:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/cjjfly.png)

Copy this URL, and it can be used as a Webhook. The sample here is `https://webhook.site/eb238c4f-da3b-47a5-a922-a93aa5405daa`.

Next, we can set the `callback_url` field to the above Webhook URL, while filling in the corresponding parameters, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/v1m05g.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Clicking run, you can find that an immediate result is obtained, as follows:

```
{
  "task_id": "b8976e18-32dc-4718-9ed8-1ea090fcb6ea"
}
```

After a moment, we can observe the result of the generated video at `https://webhook.site/eb238c4f-da3b-47a5-a922-a93aa5405daa`, as shown in the image:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/0j7nra.png)

The content is as follows:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "task_id": "b8976e18-32dc-4718-9ed8-1ea090fcb6ea",
    "trace_id": "fb751e1e-4705-49ea-9fd4-5024b7865ea2",
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "sora-2:task_01k777hjrbfrgs2060q5zvf2a5",
            "video_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/gptimage/vg-assets/assets%2Ftask_01k777hjrbfrgs2060q5zvf2a5%2Ftask_01k777hjrbfrgs2060q5zvf2a5_genid_b8e2e5d1-a579-49ca-a21c-cb3869685cce_25_10_10_14_15_147334%2Fvideos%2F00000%2Fsrc.mp4?st=2025-10-10T12%3A38%3A49Z&se=2025-10-16T13%3A38%3A49Z&sks=b&skt=2025-10-10T12%3A38%3A49Z&ske=2025-10-16T13%3A38%3A49Z&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skoid=aa5ddad1-c91a-4f0a-9aca-e20682cc8969&skv=2019-02-02&sv=2018-11-09&sr=b&sp=r&spr=https%2Chttp&sig=p4aMqXqkP%2FI1IhOVGCB9JL8vUUvfNBBF12ESpKhKXOk%3D&az=oaivgprodscus",
            "state": "succeeded"
        }
    ]
}
```

You can see that the result contains a `task_id` field, and other fields are similar to the above text, allowing the task to be associated through this field.

## Error Handling

When calling the API, if an error occurs, the API will return the corresponding error code and message. For example:

- `400 token_mismatched`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `400 api_not_implemented`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `401 invalid_token`: Unauthorized, invalid or missing authorization token.
- `429 too_many_requests`: Too many requests, you have exceeded the rate limit.
- `500 api_error`: Internal server error, something went wrong on the server.

### Error Response Example

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "api_error",
    "message": "fetch failed"
  },
  "trace_id": "2cf86e86-22a4-46e1-ac2f-032c0f2a4e89"
}
```
